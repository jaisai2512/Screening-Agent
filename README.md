# Screening Agent 
## Project Overview
Screening Agent is a conversational AI-based hiring assistant designed to streamline the recruitment process. Built using Streamlit and Metaâ€™s Generative AI, the chatbot guides users through a step-by-step interview process, collecting information about their skills, experience, and preferences. It dynamically generates additional questions and evaluates candidates based on their responses, providing insights for recruiters.

# Step-by-Step Information Gathering

Enter details like your 
- full name
- email
- years of experience
- technical skills.

Respond to dynamically generated questions crafted by the AI model.

## Technical Details
### Libraries Used

#### Streamlit
- Frontend framework for interactive web apps.
#### Groq 
- API for generating questions and evaluations.
#### dotenv 
- Manages environment variables securely.
### Model Details

Utilizes Groq(meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct) for generating content and evaluating candidates.

Modular design with an Agents class to encapsulate API interactions.
Session management using st.session_state for seamless user experience.
### Prompt Design
#### Information Gathering
Prompts are designed to elicit precise and structured responses. For example:

- Prompt for name: "What is your full name?"
- Prompt for skills: "What is your tech stack (e.g., Python, Django, SQL)?"
#### Dynamic Question Generation

##### Prompt Design for Question Generation
Our approach to crafting questions is systematic and hierarchical, ensuring a smooth progression in difficulty while analyzing the candidate's expertise. Here's the step-by-step methodology

##### 1. Necessity Question
The first question focuses on the core, essential knowledge of the candidate's stated tech stack. This ensures we establish a baseline understanding of their fundamental knowledge.
Example: "Can you explain the difference between Python lists and tuples?"

##### 2. Progressively Tougher Questions
The next four questions increase in complexity, gradually testing the candidate's problem-solving skills, application of knowledge, and deep understanding of concepts.

- Question 2 (Slightly Tougher): Introduce situational or real-world use cases to test applied knowledge.
  - Example: "How would you optimize a Python program that processes a list of 10 million items?"

- Question 3 (Intermediate): Explore technical depth by requiring a more detailed response.
  - Example: "Explain how Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) impacts multi-threading, and how can it be mitigated?"

- Question 4 (Advanced): Test theoretical understanding and ability to deal with edge cases.
  - Example: "What challenges would you face when integrating Python libraries like NumPy with C++ code, and how would you address them?"

- Question 5 (Expert-Level): Evaluate creativity and mastery by posing an open-ended question that requires a solution-oriented mindset.
  - Example: "Design an API in Python that supports asynchronous requests for real-time data fetching and briefly outline the architecture."
